Overview
========
Every Chef installation needs a Chef Repository. This is the place where
cookbooks, roles, config files and other artifacts for managing systems
with Chef will live. We strongly recommend storing this repository in a
version control system such as Git and treat it like source code.

While we prefer Git, and make this repository available via GitHub, you
are welcome to download a tar or zip archive and use your favorite
version control system to manage the code.

Repository Directories
======================
This repository contains several directories, and each directory contains
a README file that describes what it is for in greater detail, and how to
use it for managing your systems with Chef.

* `certificates/` - SSL certificates generated by `rake ssl_cert` live here.
* `code_generator/` - Cookbook for use with `chef generate`; see below.
* `config/` - Contains the Rake configuration file, `rake.rb`.
* `data_bags/` - Store data bags and items in .json in the repository.
* `environments/` - Contains chef environment files.
* `roles/` - Store roles in .rb or .json in the repository.
* `site-cookbooks/` - Cookbooks that you've created and are keeping in
  this repository

Configuration
=============
The repository uses a configuration file, `.chef/knife.rb` which is a
repository-specific configuration file for knife. If you're using the Opscode
Platform, you can download one for your organization from the management
console. If you're using the Open Source Chef Server, you can generate a new
one with `knife configure`. For more information about configuring Knife,
see the [Knife documentation][knifedoc].

This particular repository comes with a slightly UMTS specific `.chef/knife.rb`
file.  It expects the following things:

* That your chef server username is the same as either your local username _or_
  the value of the `CHEF\_SERVER\_USER` environment variable (set this
  in your profile somewhere if neccisary).
* That your orgname (OpsCode Platform only) is either "umts" or set in the
  `ORGNAME` environment variable
* That your client key is stored in `~/.chef/username.pem` (where "username"
  is your chef server username mentioned above)
* That your validation key is stored in `~/.chef/orgname-validator.pem`

ChefDK
======
We recommend use of [chef-dk][chef-dk], and as such the `.ruby\_version` in
this repository is set to "system".  If you have [direnv][direnv]
installed, it will use the `.envrc` in this repo to set up your `PATH`
and various `GEM\_SOMETHING` environment variables to work propperly with
chef-dk.

Berkshelf
=========
Cookbook dependencies are manged using [berkshelf][berks]. This is
different than a typical chef-repo where the `cookbooks/` directory
typically contains your cookbooks.  Instead, you specify their location
and version constraints in the `Berksfile`. and then use `berks install`
to put them in you berkshelf.  This is located in `~/.berkshelf/cookbooks` by
default if you're interested in poking around.

It is possible to store cookbooks in this repository; that's what the
`site-cookbooks` directory is for. However, that directory is not in the
`cookbook_path`.  If you add a cookbook there, also add it to the
`Berksfile` with a `path:` specification.

Note that, in general, the way we organize our cookbooks is to have one
cookbook per git repository.

Also use berkshelf to upload cookbooks: `berks upload [COOKBOOKS]`

Next Steps
==========
Read the README file in each of the subdirectories for more information about
what goes in those directories.
